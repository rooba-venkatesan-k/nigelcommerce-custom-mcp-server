## Code Review Protocol
When asked to review code or a PR:
1. Strictly flag any violation of the naming conventions defined above.
2. If a function is too long, provide a refactored version as a suggestion.
3. Be pedantic about error handling; do not let "todo" comments or empty catches pass.
4. If the code follows all rules, start your response with "✅ Rules Adhered To."
